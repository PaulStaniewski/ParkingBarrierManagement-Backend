# ParkingBarrierManagement-Backend

This project was developed to manage parking barrier by mobile app. 
Initially the barrier itself was managed by SMS/text messages only.
I've developed Android Application in Android Studio and Java backend using IntelliJ IDEA.
Backend use Twillio API to send control SMS/Text messages to the parking barrier.
